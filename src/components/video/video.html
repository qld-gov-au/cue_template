            <p>Hi, and welcome to our Building Queensland website.</p>

            <p>This site is a great way for you to find out what our record job-creating building program is delivering in your local community.</p>

            <p>Whether you are in Cape York, Cloncurry, or Currumbin, building work is happening right now, right across Queensland.</p>

            <p>We're building new hospitals and upgrading existing ones. We're building more roads, new police stations and better schools.</p>

            <p>And we're working on projects that embrace Queensland's wonderful environment and lifestyle, with new children's playgrounds, walking tracks and swimming pools.</p>

            <p>My Government is investing a record $18.2 billion this year in projects like this, in communities like yours â€“ and more.</p>

            <p>It's more than any other State and Territory in Australia, securing 127,000 local jobs right across Queensland.</p>

            <p>Such a massive investment in these very difficult economic times was a big decision for the Government.</p>

            <p>But I've made it my number one priority.</p>

            <p>Why? Because it means jobs for Queenslanders, and it's building now what we need for tomorrow.</p>

            <p>And behind every job is a working family.</p>

            <p>There is a lot to love about Queensland. That's why 2,000 more people every week are calling Queensland home.</p>

            <p>Our building program means better schools, better hospitals, more roads, and better public transport in communities just like yours.</p>

            <p>It's about jobs for now. But it's also about training opportunities so that we can build and hang on to the skills that we will need in better times.</p>

            <p>It's all about investing in jobs today and about building a stronger, better Queensland for the future.
